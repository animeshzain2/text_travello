(Consider the below based on the appropriate use cases and treat as a Guideline)

User Experience and Interface:

• Create intuitive and user-friendly interfaces that support the specific workflow requirements
• Implement personalized hybrid use experiences (conversation and/or visualization) with appropriate context, tonality and flexibility aligned with the required user journey

Data Architecture and Processing:

• Ensure data quality, completeness, and proper preprocessing as appropriate for the need. This may include optimal context-based retrieval
• Implement appropriate data storage solutions (both structured and unstructured as appropriate) that can handle the volume and variety of required datasets. Have cohesiveness among generated data sets
• Consider data aggregation, correlation, and summarization techniques relevant to the use case

Core AI Solution Design:

• Focus on pragmatic short to midterm solution roadmap
• Design the solution with appropriate levels of autonomy while maintaining human oversight
• Implement adaptability (or learning capabilities) based on user feedback and changing requirements
• Ensure proper grounding, references, and contextual customization for accurate and relevant outputs. Similarly consider having Guardrails in your design, intent is to have a layer. For ex: Screening and Preventing sensitive data being sent to LLM.
• Discourage LLM’s foundation learning to make decisions or recommendations for your needs.
• Provide clear explanations of reasoning and confidence levels in AI-generated results.

Technical Implementation:

• Design a robust multi-tier and modular architecture that supports scalability and maintainability
• Implement appropriate memory management, caching and token usage strategy (Context Engg)
• Ensure framework independence and configurability for future adaptability
• Include appropriate security controls, privacy protection, and audit logging
• Have rationale for choice of solution design vis a vis alternatives considered

Testing and Quality Assurance:

• Develop appropriate test scenarios that cover various use case conditions justifying the need
• Ensure test data completeness and variety to validate solution robustness
• Implement automated testing processes for continuous quality validation where appropriate

Demo:

• Plan for thorough demo scenarios that effectively showcase the solution capabilities with appropriate and adequate input data (both volume and quality)
• Explain the design options considered and selected, rationale for design
• Prepare to explain and walk through code and execution scenarios (Clean Code)
• Show your readiness to demonstrate with dynamic data inputs
• Show how AI/Gen AI made the difference to solution
• All team members' ability to explain full solution flow and answer questions related to design
